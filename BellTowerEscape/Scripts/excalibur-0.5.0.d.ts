     * var txPlayer = new ex.Texture("/assets/tx/player.png");
     *
     * // load assets
     * var loader = new ex.Loader(txPlayer);
     *
     * // start game
     * game.start(loader).then(function () {
     *
     *   // create a sprite (quick)
     *   var playerSprite = txPlayer.asSprite();
     *
     *   // create a sprite (custom)
     *   var playerSprite = new ex.Sprite(txPlayer, 0, 0, 80, 80);
     *
     * });
     * ```
     *
     * You can then assign an [[Actor]] a sprite through [[Actor.addDrawing]] and
     * [[Actor.setDrawing]].
     *
     * ## Sprite Effects
     *
     * Excalibur offers many sprite effects such as [[Effects.Colorize]] to let you manipulate
     * sprites. Keep in mind, more effects requires more power and can lead to memory or CPU
     * constraints and hurt performance.
     *
     * It's still recommended to create an [[Animation]] or build in your effects to the sprites
     * for optimal performance.

    /**
     * Sprite Sheets
     *
     * Sprite sheets are a useful mechanism for slicing up image resources into
     * separate sprites or for generating in game animations. [[Sprite|Sprites]] are organized
     * in row major order in the [[SpriteSheet]].
     *
     * You can also use a [[SpriteFont]] which is special kind of [[SpriteSheet]] for use
     * with [[Label|Labels]].
     *
     * ## Creating a SpriteSheet
     *
     * To create a [[SpriteSheet]] you need a loaded [[Texture]] resource.
     *
     * ```js
     * var game = new ex.Engine();
     * var txAnimPlayerIdle = new ex.Texture("/assets/tx/anim-player-idle.png");
     *
     * // load assets
     * var loader = new ex.Loader(txAnimPlayerIdle);
     *
     * // start game
     * game.start(loader).then(function () {
     *   var player = new ex.Actor();
     *
     *   // create sprite sheet with 5 columns, 1 row, 80x80 frames
     *   var playerIdleSheet = new ex.SpriteSheet(txAnimPlayerIdle, 5, 1, 80, 80);
     *
     *   // create animation (125ms frame speed)
     *   var playerIdleAnimation = playerIdleSheet.getAnimationForAll(game, 125);
     *
     *   // add drawing to player as "idle"
     *   player.addDrawing("idle", playerIdleAnimation);
     *
     *   // add player to game
     *   game.add(player);
     * });
     * ```
     *
     * ## Creating animations
     *
     * [[SpriteSheets]] provide a quick way to generate a new [[Animation]] instance.
     * You can use *all* the frames of a [[Texture]] ([[SpriteSheet.getAnimationForAll]])
     * or you can use a range of frames ([[SpriteSheet.getAnimationBetween]]) or you
     * can use specific frames ([[SpriteSheet.getAnimationByIndices]]).
     *
     * To create an [[Animation]] these methods must be passed an instance of [[Engine]].
     * It's recommended to generate animations for an [[Actor]] in their [[Actor.onInitialize]]
     * event because the [[Engine]] is passed to the initialization function. However, if your
     * [[Engine]] instance is in the global scope, you can create an [[Animation]] at any time
     * provided the [[Texture]] has been [[Loader|loaded]].
     *
     * ```js
     *   // create sprite sheet with 5 columns, 1 row, 80x80 frames
     *   var playerIdleSheet = new ex.SpriteSheet(txAnimPlayerIdle, 5, 1, 80, 80);
     *
     *   // create animation for all frames (125ms frame speed)
     *   var playerIdleAnimation = playerIdleSheet.getAnimationForAll(game, 125);
     *
     *   // create animation for a range of frames (2-4) (125ms frame speed)
     *   var playerIdleAnimation = playerIdleSheet.getAnimationBetween(game, 1, 3, 125);
     *
     *   // create animation for specific frames 2, 4, 5 (125ms frame speed)
     *   var playerIdleAnimation = playerIdleSheet.getAnimationByIndices(game, [1, 3, 4], 125);
     *
     *   // create a repeating animation (ping-pong)
     *   var playerIdleAnimation = playerIdleSheet.getAnimationByIndices(game, [1, 3, 4, 3, 1], 125);
     * ```
     *
     * ## Multiple rows
     *
     * Sheets are organized in "row major order" which means left-to-right, top-to-bottom.
     * Indexes are zero-based, so while you might think to yourself the first column is
     * column "1", to the engine it is column "0". You can easily calculate an index
     * of a frame using this formula:
     *
     *     Given: col = 5, row = 3, columns = 10
     *
     *     index = col + row * columns
     *     index = 4 + 2 * 10 // zero-based, subtract 1 from col & row
     *     index = 24
     *
     * You can also simply count the frames of the image visually starting from the top left
     * and beginning with zero.
     *
     * ```js
     * // get a sprite for column 3, row 6
     * var sprite = animation.getSprite(2 + 5 * 10)
     * ```

     * Sprite Fonts
     *
     * Sprite fonts are a used in conjunction with a [[Label]] to specify
     * a particular bitmap as a font.
     *
     * ## Generating the font sheet
     *
     * You can use tools such as [Bitmap Font Builder](http://www.lmnopc.com/bitmapfontbuilder/) to
     * generate a sprite sheet for you to load into Excalibur.
     *
     * ## Creating a sprite font
     *
     * Start with an image with a grid containing all the letters you want to support.
     * Once you load it into Excalibur using a [[Texture]] resource, you can create
     * a [[SpriteFont]] using the constructor.
     *
     * For example, here is a representation of a font sprite sheet for an uppercase alphabet
     * with 4 columns and 7 rows:
     *
     * ```
     * ABCD
     * EFGH
     * IJKL
     * MNOP
     * QRST
     * UVWX
     * YZ
     * ```
     *
     * Each letter is 30x30 and after Z is a blank one to represent a space.
     *
     * Then to create the [[SpriteFont]]:
     *
     * ```js
     * var game = new ex.Engine();
     * var txFont = new ex.Texture("/assets/tx/font.png");
     *
     * // load assets
     * var loader = new ex.Loader(txFont);
     *
     * // start game
     * game.start(loader).then(function () {
     *
     *   // create a font
     *   var font = new ex.SpriteFont(txFont, "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ ", true, 4, 7, 30, 30);
     *
     *   // create a label using this font
     *   var label = new ex.Label("Hello World", 0, 0, null, font);
     *
     *   // display in-game
     *   game.add(label);
     *
     * });
     * ```
     *
     * If you want to use a lowercase representation in the font, you can pass `false` for [[caseInsensitive]]
     * and the matching will be case-sensitive. In our example, you would need another 7 rows of
     * lowercase characters.
     *
     * ## Font colors
     *
     * When using sprite fonts with a [[Label]], you can set the [[Label.color]] property
     * to use different colors.
     *
     * ## Known Issues
     *
     * **One font per Label**
     * [Issue #172](https://github.com/excaliburjs/Excalibur/issues/172)
     *
     * If you intend on changing colors or applying opacity effects, you have to use
     * a new [[SpriteFont]] instance per [[Label]].
     *
     * **Using opacity removes other effects**
     * [Issue #148](https://github.com/excaliburjs/Excalibur/issues/148)
     *
     * If you apply any custom effects to the sprites in a SpriteFont, including trying to
     * use [[Label.color]], they will be removed when modifying [[Label.opacity]].

     * Tile Maps
     *
     * The [[TileMap]] class provides a lightweight way to do large complex scenes with collision
     * without the overhead of actors.
     *
     * Tile maps are made up of [[Cell|Cells]] which can draw [[TileSprite|TileSprites]]. Tile
     * maps support multiple layers and work well for building tile-based games such as RPGs,
     * adventure games, strategy games, and others. Cells can be [[Cell.solid|solid]] so
     * that Actors can't pass through them.
     *
     * We recommend using the [Tiled map editor](http://www.mapeditor.org/) to build your maps
     * and export them to JSON. You can then load them using a [[Resource|Generic Resource]]
     * and process them to create your levels. A [[TileMap]] can then be used as part of a
     * level or map class that adds enemies and builds game objects from the Tiled map.
     *
     *
     * ## Creating a tile map
     *
     * A [[TileMap]] is meant to be used in conjuction with a map editor. Creating
     * a tile map is fairly straightforward.
     *
     * You need a tile sheet (see [[SpriteSheet]]) that holds all the available tiles to
     * draw. [[TileMap]] supports multiple sprite sheets, letting you organize tile sheets
     * to your liking.
     *
     * Next, you need to populate each [[Cell]] with one or more [[TileSprite|TileSprites]]
     * using [[Cell.pushSprite]].
     * Once the [[TileMap]] is added to a [[Scene]], it will be drawn and updated.
     *
     * You can then add [[Actor|Actors]] to the [[Scene]] and interact with the [[TileMap]].
     *
     * In this example, we take in a map configuration that we designed (for example,
     * based on the exported structure of a JSON file).
     *
     * ```ts
     *
     * // define TypeScript interfaces to make our life easier
     *
     * public interface IMapDefinition {
     *   cells: IMapCellDefinition[];

     * In a real game, you will want to ensure all the textures for the sprite sheets
     * have been loaded. You could do this in the [[Resource.processDownload]] function
     * of the generic resource when loading your JSON, before creating your `Map` object.
     *
     * ## Off-screen culling
     *
     * The [[TileMap]] takes care of only drawing the portion of the map that is on-screen.
     * This significantly improves performance and essentially means Excalibur can support
     * huge maps. Since Actors off-screen are not drawn, this also means maps can support
     * many actors.
     *
     * ## Collision checks
     *
     * You can use [[TileMap.collides]] to check if a given [[Actor]] is colliding with a
     * solid [[Cell]]. This method returns an intersection [[Vector]] that represents
     * the smallest overlap with colliding cells.

     * Cameras
     *
     * [[BaseCamera]] is the base class for all Excalibur cameras. Cameras are used
     * to move around your game and set focus. They are used to determine
     * what is "off screen" and can be used to scale the game.
     *
     * Excalibur comes with a [[LockedCamera]] and a [[SideCamera]], depending on
     * your game needs.
     *
     * Cameras are attached to [[Scene|Scenes]] and can be changed by
     * setting [[Scene.camera]]. By default, a [[Scene]] is initialized with a
     * [[BaseCamera]] that doesn't move and is centered on the screen.
     *
     * ## Focus
     *
     * Cameras have a [[BaseCamera.focus|focus]] which means they center around a specific
     * [[Point]]. This can be an [[Actor]] ([[BaseCamera.setActorToFollow]]) or a specific
     * [[Point]] ([[BaseCamera.setFocus]]).
     *
     * If a camera is following an [[Actor]], it will ensure the [[Actor]] is always at the
     * center of the screen. You can use [[BaseCamera.setFocus]] instead if you wish to
     * offset the focal point.
     *
     * ## Camera Shake
     *
     * To add some fun effects to your game, the [[BaseCamera.shake]] method
     * will do a random shake. This is great for explosions, damage, and other
     * in-game effects.
     *
     * ## Camera Lerp
     *
     * "Lerp" is short for [Linear Interpolation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_interpolation)
     * and it enables the camera focus to move smoothly between two points using timing functions.
     * Set [[BaseCamera.lerp]] to `true` to enable "lerping".
     *
     * ## Camera Zooming
     *
     * To adjust the zoom for your game, use [[BaseCamera.zoom]] which will scale the
     * game accordingly. You can pass a duration to transition between zoom levels.
     *
     * ## Known Issues
     *
     * **Cameras do not support [[EasingFunctions]]**
     * [Issue #320](https://github.com/excaliburjs/Excalibur/issues/320)
     *
     * Currently [[BaseCamera.lerp]] only supports `easeInOutCubic` but will support
     * [[EasingFunctions|easing functions]] soon.
     *
     * **Actors following a path will wobble when camera is moving**
     * [Issue #276](https://github.com/excaliburjs/Excalibur/issues/276)

    /**
     * Action API
     *
     * The fluent Action API allows you to perform "actions" on
     * [[Actor|Actors]] such as following, moving, rotating, and
     * more. You can implement your own actions by implementing
     * the [[IAction]] interface.
     *
     * Actions can be chained together and can be set to repeat,
     * or can be interrupted to change.
     *
     * ## Chaining Actions
     *
     * You can chain actions to create a script because the action
     * methods return the context, allowing you to build a queue of
     * actions that get executed as part of an [[ActionQueue]].
     *
     * ```ts
     * class Enemy extends ex.Actor {
     *
     *   public patrol() {
     *
     *      // clear existing queue
     *      this.clearActions();
     *
     *      // guard a choke point
     *      // move to 100, 100 and take 1.2s
     *      // wait for 3s
     *      // move back to 0, 100 and take 1.2s
     *      // wait for 3s
     *      // repeat
     *      this.moveTo(100, 100, 1200)
     *        .delay(3000)
     *        .moveTo(0, 100, 1200)
     *        .delay(3000)
     *        .repeatForever();
     *   }
     * }
     * ```
     *
     * ## Example: Follow a Path
     *
     * You can use [[Actor.moveTo]] to move to a specific point,
     * allowing you to chain together actions to form a path.
     *
     * This example has a `Ship` follow a path that it guards by
     * spawning at the start point, moving to the end, then reversing
     * itself and repeating that forever.
     *
     * ```ts
     * public Ship extends ex.Actor {
     *
     *   public onInitialize() {
     *     var path = [
     *       new ex.Point(20, 20),
     *       new ex.Point(50, 40),
     *       new ex.Point(25, 30),
     *       new ex.Point(75, 80)
     *     ];
     *
     *     // spawn at start point
     *     this.x = path[0].x;
     *     this.y = path[0].y;
     *
     *     // create action queue
     *
     *     // forward path (skip first spawn point)
     *     for (var i = 1; i < path.length; i++) {
     *       this.moveTo(path[i].x, path[i].y, 300);
     *     }
     *
     *     // reverse path (skip last point)
     *     for (var j = path.length - 2; j >= 0; j--) {
     *       this.moveTo(path[j].x, path[j].y, 300);
     *     }
     *
     *     // repeat
     *     this.repeatForever();
     *   }
     * }
     * ```
     *
     * While this is a trivial example, the Action API allows complex
     * routines to be programmed for Actors. For example, using the
     * [Tiled Map Editor](http://mapeditor.org) you can create a map that
     * uses polylines to create paths, load in the JSON using a
     * [[Resource|Generic Resource]], create a [[TileMap]],
     * and spawn ships programmatically  while utilizing the polylines
     * to automatically generate the actions needed to do pathing.
     *
     * ## Custom Actions
     *
     * The API does allow you to implement new actions by implementing the [[IAction]]
     * interface, but this will be improved in future versions as right now it
     * is meant for the Excalibur team and can be advanced to implement.
     *
     * You can manually manipulate an Actor's [[ActionQueue]] using
     * [[Actor.actionQueue]]. For example, using [[ActionQueue.add]] for
     * custom actions.
     *
     * ## Future Plans
     *
     * The Excalibur team is working on extending and rebuilding the Action API
     * in future versions to support multiple timelines/scripts, better eventing,
     * and a more robust API to allow for complex and customized actions.
     *
     * ## Known Issues
     *
     * **Rotation actions do not use shortest angle**
     * [Issue #282](https://github.com/excaliburjs/Excalibur/issues/282)

    /**
     * Scenes
     *
     * [[Actor|Actors]] are composed together into groupings called Scenes in
     * Excalibur. The metaphor models the same idea behind real world
     * actors in a scene. Only actors in scenes will be updated and drawn.
     *
     * Typical usages of a scene include: levels, menus, loading screens, etc.
     *
     * ## Adding actors to the scene
     *
     * For an [[Actor]] to be drawn and updated, it needs to be part of the "scene graph".
     * The [[Engine]] provides several easy ways to quickly add/remove actors from the
     * current scene.
     *
     * ```js
     * var game   = new ex.Engine(...);
     *
     * var player = new ex.Actor();
     * var enemy  = new ex.Actor();
     *
     * // add them to the "root" scene
     *
     * game.add(player);
     * game.add(enemy);
     *
     * // start game
     * game.start();
     * ```
     *
     * You can also add actors to a [[Scene]] instance specifically.
     *
     * ```js
     * var game   = new ex.Engine();
     * var level1 = new ex.Scene();
     *
     * var player = new ex.Actor();
     * var enemy  = new ex.Actor();
     *
     * // add actors to level1
     * level1.add(player);
     * level1.add(enemy);
     *
     * // add level1 to the game
     * game.add("level1", level1);
     *
     * // start the game
     * game.start();
     *
     * // after player clicks start game, for example
     * game.goToScene("level1");
     *
     * ```
     *
     * ## Extending scenes
     *
     * For more complex games, you might want more control over a scene in which
     * case you can extend [[Scene]]. This is useful for menus, custom loaders,
     * and levels.
     *
     * Just use [[Engine.add]] to add a new scene to the game. You can then use
     * [[Engine.goToScene]] to switch scenes which calls [[Scene.onActivate]] for the
     * new scene and [[Scene.onDeactivate]] for the old scene. Use [[Scene.onInitialize]]
     * to perform any start-up logic, which is called once.
     *
     * **TypeScript**
     *
     * ```ts
     * class MainMenu extends ex.Scene {
     *
     *   // start-up logic, called once
     *   public onInitialize(engine: ex.Engine) { }
     *
     *   // each time the scene is entered (Engine.goToScene)
     *   public onActivate() { }
     *
     *   // each time the scene is exited (Engine.goToScene)
     *   public onDeactivate() { }
     * }
     *
     * // add to game and activate it
     * game.add("mainmenu", new MainMenu());
     * game.goToScene("mainmenu");
     * ```
     *
     * **Javascript**
     *
     * ```js
     * var MainMenu = ex.Scene.extend({
     *   // start-up logic, called once
     *   onInitialize: function (engine) { },
     *
     *   // each time the scene is activated by Engine.goToScene
     *   onActivate: function () { },
     *
     *   // each time the scene is deactivated by Engine.goToScene
     *   onDeactivate: function () { }
     * });
     *
     * game.add("mainmenu", new MainMenu());
     * game.goToScene("mainmenu");
     * ```
     *
     * ## Scene camera
     *
     * By default, a [[Scene]] is initialized with a [[BaseCamera]] which
     * does not move and centers the game world.
     *
     * Learn more about [[BaseCamera|Cameras]] and how to modify them to suit
     * your game.

    /**
     * Actors
     *
     * The most important primitive in Excalibur is an `Actor`. Anything that
     * can move on the screen, collide with another `Actor`, respond to events,
     * or interact with the current scene, must be an actor. An `Actor` **must**
     * be part of a [[Scene]] for it to be drawn to the screen.
     *
     * ## Basic actors
     *
     * For quick and dirty games, you can just create an instance of an `Actor`
     * and manipulate it directly.
     *
     * Actors (and other entities) must be added to a [[Scene]] to be drawn
     * and updated on-screen.
     *
     * ```ts
     * var player = new ex.Actor();
     *
     * // move the player
     * player.dx = 5;
     *
     * // add player to the current scene
     * game.add(player);
     * ```
     *
     * ## Extending actors
     *
     * For "real-world" games, you'll want to `extend` the `Actor` class.
     * This gives you much greater control and encapsulates logic for that
     * actor.
     *
     * You can override the [[onInitialize]] method to perform any startup logic
     * for an actor (such as configuring state). [[onInitialize]] gets called
     * **once** before the first frame an actor is drawn/updated. It is passed
     * an instance of [[Engine]] to access global state or perform coordinate math.
     *
     * **TypeScript**
     *
     * ```ts
     * class Player extends ex.Actor {
     *
     *   public level = 1;
     *   public endurance = 0;
     *   public fortitude = 0;
     *
     *   constructor() {
     *     super();
     *   }
     *
     *   public onInitialize(engine: ex.Engine) {
     *     this.endurance = 20;
     *     this.fortitude = 16;
     *   }
     *
     *   public getMaxHealth() {
     *     return (0.4 * this.endurance) + (0.9 * this.fortitude) + (this.level * 1.2);
     *   }
     * }
     * ```
     *
     * **Javascript**
     *
     * In Javascript you can use the [[extend]] method to override or add
     * methods to an `Actor`.
     *
     * ```js
     * var Player = ex.Actor.extend({
     *
     *   level: 1,
     *   endurance: 0,
     *   fortitude: 0,
     *
     *   onInitialize: function (engine) {
     *     this.endurance = 20;
     *     this.fortitude = 16;
     *   },
     *
     *   getMaxHealth: function () {
     *     return (0.4 * this.endurance) + (0.9 * this.fortitude) + (this.level * 1.2);
     *   }
     * });
     * ```
     *
     * ## Updating actors
     *
     * Override the [[update]] method to update the state of your actor each frame.
     * Typically things that need to be updated include state, drawing, or position.
     *
     * Remember to call `super.update` to ensure the base update logic is performed.
     * You can then write your own logic for what happens after that.
     *
     * The [[update]] method is passed an instance of the Excalibur engine, which
     * can be used to perform coordinate math or access global state. It is also
     * passed `delta` which is the time since the last frame, which can be used
     * to perform time-based movement or time-based math (such as a timer).
     *
     * **TypeScript**
     *
     * ```ts
     * class Player extends Actor {
     *   public update(engine: ex.Engine, delta: number) {
     *     super.update(engine, delta); // call base update logic
     *
     *     // check if player died
     *     if (this.health <= 0) {
     *       this.triggerEvent("death");
     *       this.onDeath();
     *       return;
     *     }
     *   }
     * }
     * ```
     *
     * **Javascript**
     *
     * ```js
     * var Player = ex.Actor.extend({
     *   update: function (engine, delta) {
     *     ex.Actor.prototype.update.call(this, engine, delta); // call base update logic
     *
     *     // check if player died
     *     if (this.health <= 0) {
     *       this.triggerEvent("death");
     *       this.onDeath();
     *       return;
     *     }
     *   }
     * });
     * ```
     *
     * ## Drawing actors
     *
     * Override the [[draw]] method to perform any custom drawing. For simple games,
     * you don't need to override `draw`, instead you can use [[addDrawing]] and [[setDrawing]]
     * to manipulate the textures/animations that the actor is using.
     *
     * ### Working with Textures & Sprites
     *
     * A common usage is to use a [[Texture]] or [[Sprite]] for an actor. If you are using the [[Loader]] to
     * pre-load assets, you can simply assign an actor a [[Texture]] to draw. You can
     * also create a [[Texture.asSprite|sprite from a Texture]] to quickly create a [[Sprite]] instance.
     *
     * ```ts
     * // assume Resources.TxPlayer is a 80x80 png image
     *
     * public onInitialize(engine: ex.Engine) {
     *
     *   // set as the "default" drawing
     *   this.addDrawing(Resources.TxPlayer);
     *
     *   // you can also set a Sprite instance to draw
     *   this.addDrawing(Resources.TxPlayer.asSprite());
     * }
     * ```
     *
     * ### Working with Animations
     *
     * A [[SpriteSheet]] holds a collection of sprites from a single [[Texture]].
     * Use [[SpriteSheet.getAnimationForAll]] to easily generate an [[Animation]].
     *
     * ```ts
     * // assume Resources.TxPlayerIdle is a texture containing several frames of an animation
     *
     * public onInitialize(engine: ex.Engine) {
     *
     *   // create a SpriteSheet for the animation
     *   var playerIdleSheet = new ex.SpriteSheet(Resources.TxPlayerIdle, 5, 1, 80, 80);
     *
     *   // create an animation
     *   var playerIdleAnimation = playerIdleSheet.getAnimationForAll(engine, 120);
     *
     *   // the first drawing is always the current
     *   this.addDrawing("idle", playerIdleAnimation);
     * }
     * ```
     *
     * ### Custom drawing
     *
     * You can always override the default drawing logic for an actor in the [[draw]] method,
     * for example, to draw complex shapes or to use the raw Canvas API.
     *
     * Usually you should call `super.draw` to perform the base drawing logic, but other times
     * you may want to take over the drawing completely.
     *
     * ```ts
     * public draw(ctx: Canvas2DRenderingContext, delta: number) {
     *
     *   super.draw(ctx, delta); // perform base drawing logic
     *
     *   // custom drawing
     *   ctx.lineTo(...);
     * }
     * ```
     *
     * ## Actions
     *
     * You can use the [[ActionContext|Action API]] to create chains of
     * actions and script actors into doing your bidding for your game.
     *
     * Actions can be simple or can be chained together to create complex
     * AI routines. In the future, it will be easier to create timelines or
     * scripts to run depending on the state of your actor, such as an
     * enemy ship that is Guarding a path and then is Alerted when a Player
     * draws near.
     *
     * Learn more about the [[ActionContext|Action API]].
     *
     * ## Collision Detection
     *
     * By default Actors do not participate in collisions. If you wish to make
     * an actor participate, you need to enable the [[CollisionDetectionModule]]
     *
     * ```ts
     * public Player extends ex.Actor {
     *   constructor() {
     *     super();
     *
     *     // enable the pipeline
     *     this.pipelines.push(new ex.CollisionDetectionModule());
     *
     *     // set preferred CollisionType
     *     this.collisionType = ex.CollisionType.Active;
     *   }
     * }
     * ```
     *
     * ### Collision Groups
     *
     * TODO, needs more information.
     *
     * ## Known Issues
     *
     * **Actor bounding boxes do not rotate**
     * [Issue #68](https://github.com/excaliburjs/Excalibur/issues/68)
     *
     * **Setting opacity when using a color doesn't do anything**
     * [Issue #364](https://github.com/excaliburjs/Excalibur/issues/364)
     *
     * **Spawning an Actor next to another sometimes causes unexpected placement**
     * [Issue #319](https://github.com/excaliburjs/Excalibur/issues/319)
     *
     * **[[Actor.contains]] doesn't work with child actors and relative coordinates**

    /**
     * Excalibur's internal event dispatcher implementation.
     * Callbacks are fired immediately after an event is published.
     * Typically you'd use [[Class.eventDispatcher]] since most classes in
     * Excalibur inherit from [[Class]]. You'd rarely create an `EventDispatcher`
     * yourself.
     *
     * When working with events, be sure to keep in mind the order of subscriptions
     * and try not to create a situation that requires specific things to happen in
     * order. Events are best used for input events, tying together disparate objects,
     * or for UI updates.
     *
     * ## Example: Actor events
     *
     * Actors implement an EventDispatcher ([[Actor.eventDispatcher]]) so they can
     * send and receive events. For example, they can enable Pointer events (mouse/touch)
     * and you can respond to them by subscribing to the event names.
     *
     * You can also emit any other kind of event for your game just by using a custom
     * `string` value and implementing a class that inherits from [[GameEvent]].
     *
     * ```js
     * var player = new ex.Actor(...);
     *
     * // Enable pointer events for this actor
     * player.enableCapturePointer = true;
     *
     * // subscribe to pointerdown event
     * player.on("pointerdown", function (evt: ex.Input.PointerEvent) {
     *   console.log("Player was clicked!");
     * });
     *
     * // turn off subscription
     * player.off("pointerdown");
     *
     * // subscribe to custom event
     * player.on("death", function (evt) {
     *   console.log("Player died:", evt);
     * });
     *
     * // trigger custom event
     * player.triggerEvent("death", new DeathEvent());
     *
     * ```
     *
     * ## Example: Pub/Sub with Excalibur
     *
     * You can also create an EventDispatcher for any arbitrary object, for example
     * a global game event aggregator (`vent`). Anything in your game can subscribe to
     * it, if the event aggregator is in the global scope.
     *
     * *Warning:* This can easily get out of hand. Avoid this usage, it just serves as
     * an example.
     *
     * ```js
     * // create a publisher on an empty object
     * var vent = new ex.EventDispatcher({});
     *
     * // handler for an event
     * var subscription = function (event) {
     *   console.log(event);
     * }
     *
     * // add a subscription
     * vent.subscribe("someevent", subscription);
     *
     * // publish an event somewhere in the game
     * vent.publish("someevent", new ex.GameEvent());
     * ```

     * Animations
     *
     * Animations allow you to display a series of images one after another,
     * creating the illusion of change. Generally these images will come from a [[SpriteSheet]] source.
     *
     * ## Creating an animation
     *
     * Create a [[Texture]] that contains the frames of your animation. Once the texture
     * is [[Loader|loaded]], you can then generate an [[Animation]] by creating a [[SpriteSheet]]
     * and using [[SpriteSheet.getAnimationForAll]].
     *
     * ```js
     * var game = new ex.Engine();
     * var txAnimPlayerIdle = new ex.Texture("/assets/tx/anim-player-idle.png");
     *
     * // load assets
     * var loader = new ex.Loader(txAnimPlayerIdle);
     *
     * // start game
     * game.start(loader).then(function () {
     *   var player = new ex.Actor();
     *
     *   // create sprite sheet with 5 columns, 1 row, 80x80 frames
     *   var playerIdleSheet = new ex.SpriteSheet(txAnimPlayerIdle, 5, 1, 80, 80);
     *
     *   // create animation (125ms frame speed)
     *   var playerIdleAnimation = playerIdleSheet.getAnimationForAll(game, 125);
     *
     *   // add drawing to player as "idle"
     *   player.addDrawing("idle", playerIdleAnimation);
     *
     *   // add player to game
     *   game.add(player);
     * });
     * ```
     *
     * ## Sprite effects
     *
     * You can add [[SpriteEffect|sprite effects]] to an animation through methods
     * like [[Animation.invert]] or [[Animation.lighten]]. Keep in mind, since this
     * manipulates the raw pixel values of a [[Sprite]], it can have a performance impact.

    /**
     * Promises/A+ spec implementation of promises
     *
     * Promises are used to do asynchronous work and they are useful for
     * creating a chain of actions. In Excalibur they are used for loading,
     * sounds, animation, actions, and more.
     *
     * ## A Promise Chain
     *
     * Promises can be chained together and can be useful for creating a queue
     * of functions to be called when something is done.
     *
     * The first [[Promise]] you will encounter is probably [[Engine.start]]
     * which resolves when the game has finished loading.
     *
     * ```js
     * var game = new ex.Engine();
     *
     * // perform start-up logic once game is ready
     * game.start().then(function () {
     *
     *   // start-up & initialization logic
     *
     * });
     * ```
     *
     * ## Handling errors
     *
     * You can optionally pass an error handler to [[Promise.then]] which will handle
     * any errors that occur during Promise execution.
     *
     * ```js
     * var game = new ex.Engine();
     *
     * game.start().then(
     *   // success handler
     *   function () {
     *   },
     *
     *   // error handler
     *   function (err) {
     *   }
     * );
     * ```

     * Labels
     *
     * Labels are the way to draw small amounts of text to the screen. They are
     * actors and inherit all of the benifits and capabilities.
     *
     * ## Creating a Label
     *
     * You can pass in arguments to the [[Label.constructor]] or simply set the
     * properties you need after creating an instance of the [[Label]].
     *
     * Since labels are [[Actor|Actors]], they need to be added to a [[Scene]]
     * to be drawn and updated on-screen.
     *
     * ```js
     * var game = new ex.Engine();
     *
     * // constructor
     * var label = new ex.Label("Hello World", 50, 50, "10px Arial");
     *
     * // properties
     * var label = new ex.Label();
     * label.x = 50;
     * label.y = 50;
     * label.font = "10px Arial";
     * label.text = "Foo";
     * label.color = ex.Color.White;
     * label.textAlign = ex.TextAlign.Center;
     *
     * // add to current scene
     * game.add(label);
     *
     * // start game
     * game.start();
     * ```
     *
     * ## Web Fonts
     *
     * The HTML5 Canvas API draws text using CSS syntax. Because of this, web fonts
     * are fully supported. To draw a web font, follow the same procedure you use
     * for CSS. Then simply pass in the font string to the [[Label]] constructor
     * or set [[Label.font]].
     *
     * **index.html**
     *
     * ```html
     * <!doctype html>
     * <html>
     * <head>
     *   <!-- Include the web font per usual -->
     *   <script src="//google.com/fonts/foobar"></script>
     * </head>
     * <body>
     *   <canvas id="game"></canvas>
     *   <script src="game.js"></script>
     * </body>
     * </html>
     * ```
     *
     * **game.js**
     *
     * ```js
     * var game = new ex.Engine();
     *
     * var label = new ex.Label();
     * label.font = "12px Foobar, Arial, Sans-Serif";
     * label.text = "Hello World";
     *
     * game.add(label);
     * game.start();
     * ```
     *
     * ## Performance Implications
     *
     * It is recommended to use a [[SpriteFont]] for labels as the raw Canvas
     * API for drawing text is slow (`fillText`). Too many labels that
     * do not use sprite fonts will visibly affect the frame rate of your game.
     *
     * Alternatively, you can always use HTML and CSS to draw UI elements, but
     * currently Excalibur does not provide a way to easily interact with the
     * DOM. Still, this will not affect canvas performance and is a way to
     * lighten your game, if needed.

     * Mouse and Touch (Pointers)
     *
     * Handles pointer events (mouse, touch, stylus, etc.) and normalizes to
     * [W3C Pointer Events](http://www.w3.org/TR/pointerevents/).
     *
     * There is always at least one [[Pointer]] available ([[Pointers.primary]]) and
     * you can request multiple pointers to support multi-touch scenarios.
     *
     * Since [[Pointers.primary]] normalizes both mouse and touch events, your game
     * automatically supports touch for the primary pointer by default. When
     * you handle the events, you can customize what your game does based on the type
     * of pointer, if applicable.
     *
     * Excalibur handles mouse/touch events and normalizes them to a [[PointerEvent]]
     * that your game can subscribe to and handle (`engine.input.pointers`).
     *
     * ## Events
     *
     * You can subscribe to pointer events through `engine.input.pointers`. A [[PointerEvent]] object is
     * passed to your handler which offers information about the pointer input being received.
     *
     * - `down` - When a pointer is pressed down (any mouse button or finger press)
     * - `up` - When a pointer is lifted
     * - `move` - When a pointer moves (be wary of performance issues when subscribing to this)
     * - `cancel` - When a pointer event is canceled for some reason
     *
     * ```js
     * engine.input.pointers.primary.on("down", function (evt) { });
     * engine.input.pointers.primary.on("up", function (evt) { });
     * engine.input.pointers.primary.on("move", function (evt) { });
     * engine.input.pointers.primary.on("cancel", function (evt) { });
     * ```
     *
     * ## Pointer scope (window vs. canvas)
     *
     * You have the option to handle *all* pointer events in the browser by setting
     * [[IEngineOptions.pointerScope]] to [[PointerScope.Document]]. If this is enabled,
     * Excalibur will handle every pointer event in the browser. This is useful for handling
     * complex input and having control over every interaction.
     *
     * You can also use [[PointerScope.Canvas]] to only scope event handling to the game
     * canvas. This is useful if you don't care about events that occur outside.
     *
     * One real-world example is dragging and gestures. Sometimes a player will drag their
     * finger outside your game and then into it, expecting it to work. If [[PointerScope]]
     * is set to [[PointerScope.Canvas|Canvas]] this will not work. If it is set to
     * [[PointerScope.Document|Document]], it will.
     *
     * ## Responding to input
     *
     * The primary pointer can be a mouse, stylus, or 1 finger touch event. You
     * can inspect what it is from the [[PointerEvent]] handled.
     *
     * ```js
     * engine.input.pointers.primary.on("down", function (pe) {
     *   if (pe.pointerType === ex.Input.PointerType.Mouse) {
     *     ex.Logger.getInstance().info("Mouse event:", pe);
     *   } else if (pe.pointerType === ex.Input.PointerType.Touch) {
     *     ex.Logger.getInstance().info("Touch event:", pe);
     *   }
     * });
     * ```
     *
     * ## Multiple Pointers (Multi-Touch)
     *
     * When there is more than one pointer detected on the screen,
     * this is considered multi-touch. For example, pressing one finger,
     * then another, will create two pointers. If you lift a finger,
     * the first one remains and the second one disappears.
     *
     * You can handle multi-touch by subscribing to however many pointers
     * you would like to support. If a pointer doesn't yet exist, it will
     * be created. You do not need to check if a pointer exists. If it does
     * exist, it will propogate events, otherwise it will remain idle.
     *
     * Excalibur does not impose a limit to the amount of pointers you can
     * subscribe to, so by all means, support all 10 fingers.
     *
     * *Note:* There is no way to identify touches after they happen; you can only
     * know that there are *n* touches on the screen at once.
     *
     * ```js
     * function paint(color) {
     *
     *   // create a handler for the event
     *   return function (pe) {
     *     if (pe.pointerType === ex.Input.PointerType.Touch) {
     *       engine.canvas.fillStyle = color;
     *       engine.canvas.fillRect(pe.x, pe.y, 5, 5);
     *     }
     *   }
     * }
     *
     * engine.input.pointers.at(0).on("move", paint("blue"));  // 1st finger
     * engine.input.pointers.at(1).on("move", paint("red"));   // 2nd finger
     * engine.input.pointers.at(2).on("move", paint("green")); // 3rd finger
     * ```
     *
     * ## Actor pointer events
     *
     * By default, [[Actor|Actors]] do not participate in pointer events. In other
     * words, when you "click" an Actor, it will not throw an event **for that Actor**,
     * only a generic pointer event for the game. This is to keep performance
     * high and allow actors to "opt-in" to handling pointer events.
     *
     * To opt-in, set [[Actor.enableCapturePointer]] to `true` and the [[Actor]] will
     * start publishing `pointerup` and `pointerdown` events. `pointermove` events
     * will not be published by default due to performance implications. If you want
     * an actor to receive move events, set [[ICapturePointerConfig.captureMoveEvents]] to
     * `true`.
     *
     * Actor pointer events will be prefixed with `pointer`.
     *
     * ```js
     * var player = new ex.Actor();
     *
     * // enable propogating pointer events
     * player.enableCapturePointer = true;
     *
     * // enable move events, warning: performance intensive!
     * player.capturePointer.captureMoveEvents = true;
     *
     * // subscribe to input
     * player.on("pointerup", function (ev) {
     *   player.logger.info("Player selected!", ev);
     * });
     * ```

     * Controller Support (Gamepads)
     *
     * Excalibur leverages the HTML5 Gamepad API [where it is supported](http://caniuse.com/#feat=gamepad)
     * to provide controller support for your games.
     *
     * You can query any [[Gamepad|Gamepads]] that are connected or listen to events ("button" and "axis").
     *
     * You must opt-in to controller support ([[Gamepads.enabled]]) because it is a polling-based
     * API, so we have to check it each update frame.
     *
     * Any number of gamepads are supported using the [[Gamepads.at]] method. If a [[Gamepad]] is
     * not connected, it will simply not throw events.
     *
     * ## Responding to button input
     *
     * [[Buttons|Gamepad buttons]] typically have values between 0 and 1, however depending on
     * the sensitivity of the controller, even if a button is idle it could have a
     * very tiny value. For this reason, you can pass in a threshold to several
     * methods to customize how sensitive you want to be in detecting button presses.
     *
     * You can inspect any connected [[Gamepad]] using [[Gamepad.isButtonPressed]], [[Gamepad.getButton]],
     * or you can subscribe to the `button` event published on the [[Gamepad]] which passes
     * a [[GamepadButtonEvent]] to your handler.
     *
     * ```js
     * // enable gamepad support
     * engine.input.gamepads.enabled = true;
     *
     * // query gamepad on update
     * engine.on("update", function (ev) {
     *
     *   // access any gamepad by index
     *   if (engine.input.gamepads.at(0).isButtonPressed(ex.Input.Buttons.Face1)) {
     *     ex.Logger.getInstance().info("Controller A button pressed");
     *   }
     *
     *   // query individual button
     *   if (engine.input.gamepads.at(0).getButton(ex.Input.Buttons.DpadLeft) > 0.2) {
     *     ex.Logger.getInstance().info("Controller D-pad left value is > 0.2")
     *   }
     * });
     *
     * // subscribe to button events
     * engine.input.gamepads.at(0).on("button", function (ev) {
     *   ex.Logger.getInstance().info(ev.button, ev.value);
     * });
     * ```
     *
     * ## Responding to axis input
     *
     * [[Axes|Gamepad axes]] typically have values between -1 and 1, but even idle
     * sticks can still propogate very small values depending on the quality and age
     * of a controller. For this reason, you can set [[Gamepads.MinAxisMoveThreshold]]
     * to set the (absolute) threshold after which Excalibur will start publishing `axis` events.
     * By default it is set to a value that normally will not throw events if a stick is idle.
     *
     * You can query axes via [[Gamepad.getAxes]] or by subscribing to the `axis` event on [[Gamepad]]
     * which passes a [[GamepadAxisEvent]] to your handler.
     *
     * ```js
     * // enable gamepad support
     * engine.input.gamepads.enabled = true;
     *
     * // query gamepad on update
     * engine.on("update", function (ev) {
     *
     *   // access any gamepad by index
     *   var axisValue;
     *   if ((axisValue = engine.input.gamepads.at(0).getAxes(ex.Input.Axes.LeftStickX)) > 0.5) {
     *     ex.Logger.getInstance().info("Move right", axisValue);
     *   }
     * });
     *
     * // subscribe to axis events

    /**
     * The Excalibur Engine
     *
     * The [[Engine]] is the main driver for a game. It is responsible for
     * starting/stopping the game, maintaining state, transmitting events,
     * loading resources, and managing the scene.
     *
     * Excalibur uses the HTML5 Canvas API for drawing your game to the screen.
     * The canvas is available to all `draw` functions for raw manipulation,
     * but Excalibur is meant to simplify or completely remove the need to use
     * the canvas directly.
     *
     * ## Creating a Game
     *
     * To create a new game, create a new instance of [[Engine]] and pass in
     * the configuration ([[IEngineOptions]]). Excalibur only supports a single
     * instance of a game at a time, so it is safe to use globally.
     *
     * You can then call [[start]] which starts the game and optionally accepts
     * a [[Loader]] which you can use to pre-load assets.
     *
     * ```js
     * var game = new ex.Engine({ width: 800, height: 600 });
     *
     * // call game.start, which is a Promise
     * game.start().then(function () {
     *   // ready, set, go!
     * });
     * ```
     *
     * ## The Main Loop
     *
     * The Excalibur engine uses a simple main loop. The engine updates and renders
     * the "scene graph" which is the [[Scene|scenes]] and the tree of [[Actor|actors]] within that
     * scene. Only one [[Scene]] can be active at once, the engine does not update/draw any other
     * scene, which means any actors will not be updated/drawn if they are part of a deactivated scene.
     *
     * **Scene Graph**
     *
     * ```
     * Engine
     *   |_ Scene 1 (activated)
     *     |_ Actor 1
     *       |_ Child Actor 1
     *     |_ Actor 2
     *   |_ Scene 2 (deactiveated)
     *   |_ Scene 3 (deactiveated)
     * ```
     *
     * The engine splits the game into two primary responsibilities: updating and drawing. This is
     * to keep your game smart about splitting duties so that you aren't drawing when doing
     * logic or performing logic as you draw.
     *
     * ### Update Loop
     *
     * The first operation run is the [[Engine.update|update]] loop. [[Actor]] and [[Scene]] both implement
     * an overridable/extendable `update` method. Use it to perform any logic-based operations
     * in your game for a particular class.
     *
     * ### Draw Loop
     *
     * The next step is the [[Engine.draw|draw]] loop. A [[Scene]] loops through its child [[Actor|actors]] and
     * draws each one. You can override the `draw` method on an actor to customize its drawing.
     * You should **not** perform any logic in a draw call, it should only relate to drawing.
     *
     * ## Working with Scenes
     *
     * The engine automatically creates a "root" [[Scene]]. You can use this for whatever you want.
     * You can manipulate scenes using [[Engine.add|add]], [[Engine.remove|remove]],
     * and [[Engine.goToScene|goToScene]]. You can overwrite or remove the `root` scene if
     * you want. There always has to be at least one scene and only **one** scene can be
     * active at any one time.
     *
     * Learn more about the [[Scene|scene lifecycle]].
     *
     * ### Adding a scene
     *
     * ```js
     * var game = new ex.Engine();
     *
     * // create a new level
     * var level1 = new ex.Scene();
     *
     * // add level 1 to the game
     * game.add("level1", level1);
     *
     * // in response to user input, go to level 1
     * game.goToScene("level1");
     *
     * // go back to main menu
     * game.goToScene("root");
     * ```
     *
     * ### Accessing the current scene
     *
     * To add actors and other entities to the current [[Scene]], you can use [[Engine.add|add]]. Alternatively,
     * you can use [[Engine.currentScene]] to directly access the current scene.
     *
     * ## Managing the Viewport
     *
     * Excalibur supports multiple [[DisplayMode|display modes]] for a game. Pass in a `displayMode`
     * option when creating a game to customize the viewport.
     *
     * ## Extending the Engine
     *
     * For complex games, any entity that inherits [[Class]] can be extended to override built-in
     * functionality. This is recommended for [[Actor|actors]] and [[Scene|scenes]], especially.
     *
     * You can customize the options or provide more for your game by extending [[Engine]].
     *
     * **TypeScript**
     *
     * ```ts
     * class Game extends ex.Engine {
     *
     *   constructor() {
     *     super({ width: 800, height: 600, displayMode: DisplayMode.FullScreen });
     *   }
     *
     *   public start() {
     *     // add custom scenes
     *     this.add("mainmenu", new MainMenu());
     *
     *     return super.start(myLoader).then(() => {
     *
     *       this.goToScene("mainmenu");
     *
     *       // custom start-up
     *     });
     *   }
     * }
     *
     * var game = new Game();
     * game.start();
     * ```
     *
     * **Javascript**
     *
     * ```js
     * var Game = ex.Engine.extend({
     *
     *   constructor: function () {
     *     Engine.call(this, { width: 800, height: 600, displayMode: DisplayMode.FullScreen });
     *   }
     *
     *   start: function() {
     *     // add custom scenes
     *     this.add("mainmenu", new MainMenu());
     *
     *     var _this = this;
     *     return Engine.prototype.start.call(this, myLoader).then(function() {
     *

     *       // custom start-up

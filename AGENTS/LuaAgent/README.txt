Requirements:

  The easiest way to get this going is to download Zero Brane Studio
  (http://studio.zerobrane.com/) and load up these two files. From there,
  all you need to do is load up these two files and you should be good to go.

  For submission, just submit these two files and we'll call it good.

  BUT, if you are truly interested in how to package up Lua, the easiest way is
  to get a binary package - the scilua one (http://www.scilua.org/get.html) has
  alot of the necessary packages (like sockets) - and add these files to the
  package. Come talk to Shakil for any additional info on Lua packaging.
